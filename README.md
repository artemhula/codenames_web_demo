## How to Play 📝
- The game is played in two teams: **red** and **blue**.  
- Each team has a **spymaster** and **field operatives**.  
- The spymaster gives one-word clues and a number, hinting at specific words on the board.  
- Operatives try to guess their team’s words based on the clue.  
- Be careful! Guessing the opponent’s words helps the other team, and guessing the **assassin word** ends the game instantly.  
- The first team to find all their words wins! 🎯  

Enjoy the game! 🎉
